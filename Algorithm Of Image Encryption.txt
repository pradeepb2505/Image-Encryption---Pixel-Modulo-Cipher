  Let C1 be the color matrix of the image to be encrypted
  Let C2 be the color matrix of the key image
  Let C3 be the color matrix of the encrypted image
  Let i represent the row of the pixel
  Let j represent the column of the pixel
  r, g, b be the respective Red, Green and Blue color values
  of the (i,j) pixel
  r(C3[i][j] ) = (r(C1[i][j]) + r(C2[i][j]))  % 255
  g(C3[i][j] ) = (g(C1[i][j]) + g(C2[i][j]))  % 255
  b(C3[i][j] ) = (b(C1[i][j]) + b(C2[i][j]))  % 255
  The final Encrypted image can be obtained by setting the rgb values to the ith column jth row of the pixel.
